# passwordless-transition-poc

This repository offers a comprehensive overview of the passwordless transition process. It focuses on a Proof of Concept developed during an internship at Microsoft, aiming to serve as a reference for future implementations and migrations towards passwordless authentication in Azure.

It is important to note that this deployment is a simplified version of a test environment with additional resources and configurations. Passwords, usernames, and ports are placeholders and should be changed before deploying the demo.
